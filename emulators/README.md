## Prerequisites
The test runner used by Sauce Labs to execute the Espresso tests is a downloadable file.
The current release is provided in this release but can also be downloaded from the [Sauce Labs Wiki](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Sauce+Runner+for+Virtual+Devices+Change+Logs).

The scripts in this repo were developed on macOS and expect JDK 8 or higher to be installed and available.

## Setup
A prebuilt native Android application and it's Espresso test cases are included in this repo. Source to this application can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/saucelabs/sample-app-mobile).

The application is bundled in [`SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.Espresso.App.apk`](./SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.Espresso.App.apk) and the tests cases are bundled in [`SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.Espresso.Tests.apk`](./SauceLabs.Mobile.Sample.Espresso.Tests.apk).

Make sure that you've added the following to your environment variables

```bash
# For OSX/Linux
export SAUCE_USERNAME=********
export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=*******
```

## Execution
Executing a test from this repository is a matter of running `runner-ex{number}.sh` where `{number}` is the number of the example (1 ... 4).  Make sure to navigate to the emulators directory you made a copy of

If you run this for the first time on your Mac you might get a warning that the `sauce-runner-virtual` is not safe,
then go to

## Examples
There are 6 examples provided starting from the most basic and moving up to more advanced approaches. 
More options can be found on the [Sauce Labs Wiki](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Command+Reference+for+Sauce+Runner+for+Virtual+Devices).

> Note that you need to have the devices available on the same data center (EU-Central) and append a `./` before each command such as `./runner-ex1.sh`

### Example 1 - Configuration for all tests
`runner-ex1.sh`: In this example, all test cases are executed on a single emulator in sequential order.

### Example 2 - Configuration for 2 tests
`runner-ex2.sh`: In this example, there are two test cases executed on a single device in sequential order.

### Example 3 - Run one test on 2 devices
`runner-ex3.yml`: In this example, there is one test which is executed on 2 devices.

### Example 4 - Exclude 1 test
`runner-ex4.sh`: In this example, all test cases are executed on a single emulator in sequential order except for 1.

### Example 5 - Single file test annotation
`runner-ex5.sh`: Demonstrates the ability to run four tests based on the `@ErrorFlow`-annotation in a single class,
see [here](https://github.com/saucelabs/sample-app-mobile/blob/master/android/app/src/androidTest/java/com/swaglabsmobileapp/LoginTest.kt#L54).

### Example 6 - Multi file test annotation
`runner-ex6.sh`: Demonstrates the ability to run two tests based on the `@HappyFlow`-annotation which are found in two classes,
see [here](https://github.com/saucelabs/sample-app-mobile/blob/master/android/app/src/androidTest/java/com/swaglabsmobileapp/LoginTest.kt#L34)
and [here](https://github.com/saucelabs/sample-app-mobile/blob/master/android/app/src/androidTest/java/com/swaglabsmobileapp/SwagLabsFlow.kt#L35).
